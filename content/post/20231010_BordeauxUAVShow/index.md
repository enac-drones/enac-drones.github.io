We participated to Bordeaux UAV Show with our micro U-space deployment !

The ENAC - Airbus - Sopra Steria Drones & UTM Chair team was in Bordeaux on October 10, 2023. This was an opportunity to present our work, notably through the simulation of the micro U-space airspace, with services rendered in real time (based on European regulations). The Chair thus presented its advances in strategic deconfliction.

A great success for the team among the many visitors to the show!
