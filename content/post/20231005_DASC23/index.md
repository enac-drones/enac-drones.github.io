<!-- We have presented our recent work on deconfliction with 2 papers during the conference. -->
At 42nd Digital Avionic Systems Conference (DASC), 2023 in Barcelona, the Chair was represented by Adrian del Ser and Murat Bronz, along with Zeynep Bilgin from TUM (Technical University of Munich). The Chair used this opportunity to present Adrian’s paper titled Minimal Communication between Drones Using Guidance Vector Fields in Dense Airspace. The paper inspects the effect of reducing communication rate between a group of drones on collision avoidance capabilities. For our second paper titled Automatic In Flight Conflict Resolution for Urban Air Mobility using Fluid Flow Vector Field based Guidance Algorithm we have collaborated with TUM. In this work various flight corridor models were developed for urban air traffic management.

The sessions proved to be both interactive and informative, offering updates on the latest in path planning and the assimilation of UAVs into commercial airspace. The trip was complemented by Barcelona’s delightful cuisine and a relaxing visit to the beach.
