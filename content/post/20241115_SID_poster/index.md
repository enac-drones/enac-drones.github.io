<!-- U-space Advanced Strategic Deconfliction:  -->

We are preparing a poster for the SESAR Innovation Days 2024.

<!--more-->

Our project enhances the Digital European Sky by extending the U-spaceChain framework with an advanced deconfliction module, offering improved safety and coordination in unmanned aircraft operations. By integrating strategic deconfliction and flight trajectory optimization using decentralized blockchain technology, we enable more resilient and secure UTM systems. This approach aligns with Europe's vision of increasing automation, reducing human intervention, and ensuring seamless air traffic management. Additionally, the extensibility of the U-spaceChain framework allows for future integration of other innovative services, supporting the evolution of a robust, scalable, and interoperable European U-space ecosystem.
