Research engineer for ENAC - Airbus - Sopra Steria in the Drones & UTM research chair. 

Adrian has a multilingual and multicultural background, having grown up in Kazakhstan and England. He has an aeronautical and mechanical engineering degree from the University of Cambridge and has done internships in Austria and Malaysia. He also participated in a robotics competition and obtained his private pilot's license.  

Through the design of drones and their control systems, he is motivated by the challenge of UAV integration into a modern airspace environment. He is also interested in any opportunity to acquire new skills, particularly in the field of robotics programming and development. His experience with flying and modern airspace use is an additional asset for the chair.
