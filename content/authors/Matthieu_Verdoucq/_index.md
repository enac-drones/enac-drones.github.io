Matthieu Verdoucq has a PhD in aerial robotics and bio-inspiration, made on the integration of a bio-inspired model for achieving collective motion of a swarm of UAVs. His work in swarm engineering and his diploma in Avionics and embedded systems has given him a lot of knowledge on UAVs systems and on the challenges arising from the deployment of several agents in a confined spaces, with a lot of constraints. His activites at Chaire ENAC encapsulates trajectory planning, fleet guidance and  optimization for building resilient UAV systems.
