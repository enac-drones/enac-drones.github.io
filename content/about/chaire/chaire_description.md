The successor to the "Drone Systems" Chair created in 2015, the "ENAC-Airbus-Sopra Steria Drones & UTM Chair", launched in 2023, will focus its work on topics related to UTM ("Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management"). In addition to integrating drones and their new services into existing systems, it aims to address the issue of their social acceptability.
To achieve this, it addresses technical issues such as the ATM/UTM interface, tactical deconfliction and Artificial Intelligence, as well as regulatory issues such as system certification and standardization. Its work is intended to lay the foundations for the effective integration of drones and their public acceptability, which is crucial when considering the use of drones in new urban mobilities.
Its research activities focus on three main areas:
- ATM/UTM ("Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management") interaction, including in particular the safe and robust integration of drones in airspace, the interoperability and integration of USSPs (U-Space Services Providers) with each other and with ANSPs (Air Navigation Service Providers), the "Human Factors" approach and the social acceptability of new services (in particular those linked to Urban Air Mobility);
- Deconfliction methods, including strategic deconfliction (trajectories, optimization and time management to enable airspace integration) and tactical deconfliction (ground and onboard deconfliction algorithms, impact of weather on operations, see & avoid, drone fleet management, etc.);
- Artificial intelligence applied to UTM, including Machine Learning experiments and the implementation of tactical services for greater flight safety, as well as work on ground/board data exchanges, notably for managing degraded situations.
These subjects, which are essential to tomorrow's air transport and particularly strategic for all those involved, can now be addressed thanks to the support of the Chair's corporate sponsors.
Olivier Chansou, Managing Director of ENAC, comments: « We would like to thank Airbus and Sopra Steria for their trust and support, which will enable us to maintain our position as European leaders in key areas for the future of the air transport sector, by continuing the work carried out within this Chair. »

<!-- ENAC is internationally recognized as the leading aeronautics and aviation university in Europe, providing a broad range of training, studies and research activities.
École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile (ENAC), the school of the Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile (Civil Aviation Authority, or DGAC) under the supervision of the French Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity Transition, combines education and research in aeronautical engineering, air navigation and aircraft piloting.

Every year ENAC admits over 2000 students who are enrolled in more than 30 programmes of study, and 3500 trainees enrolled in continuing education programmes.

ENAC’s 24,000 graduates can be found in some 100 different countries on all 5 continents – proof of the school’s international influence. Its scale and its human and pedagogical resources make ENAC the leading European school of aeronautics today.

Since its creation in 1949, ENAC has provided professional training to civil aviation personnel such as Air Traffic Controllers, ATSEPs and technicians for Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA) or Air Navigation Service Providers from all over the world (e.g. China, Switzerland, EuroControl, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Africa, Georgia, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia).

ENAC alumni work in aeronautical and aviation companies, in fields such as manufacturing (Airbus, ATR, Embraer, Safran, P&W, GE, Rockwell Collins, Thales, Indra), and airports, airlines, civil aviation authorities as well as air navigation providers across the globe.

ENAC is also known internationally for its training of ATPL and MPL pilots for airlines including Air France, Easyjet, Transavia, Sichuan Airline, China Eastern, Shanghai Airline, Lao Airline, Oman Air and Royal Air Maroc.

Innovative ENAC research laboratories work in cooperation with the best universities worldwide to provide a safer, more efficient and more sustainable air transport system.
